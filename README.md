# [GCD] AntiCheat

The GCD AntiCheat uses the vanilla Scripting API to fight weaknesses in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.

# Setup

Since this uses the Scripting API, this will only work in Windows 10 servers, for example, a windows 10 edition hosted world or dedicated server.
Make sure you enable Experimental Gameplay on your world after installing the addon. 
Once you have did that, to get GCDAdmin (to not get flagged) simply do /function gcd/admin .
To be notified for all detected cheats, do /function notify/on/all .
To edit the config, you can either edit the script itself, or to edit the ingame config do /function gcd/help 
It will show you how to edit the config ingame. To view the config, do /tag @s add GCDConfig

# Flags

# Information

No anti cheat is perfect so this one isn't perfect. Right now there is a problem with occasional false flagging for flags such as Reach (reduced in 1.3.2), Flight and occasional No-clip (both are currently command-based). If you are testing this, to make sure players don't get kicked when they cheat, do /scoreboard players set neverKick GCD 1. This will give them a timesflagged count, but won't kick them when they get flagged. However, if they have been flagged for enough times, they will get auto-banned.
